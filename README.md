# Pytor's Computer
An 8-bit computer I built for my dad

# What
This is an 8-bit computer. It is meant to be like a Commodore 64 with some improvements.
There will be a custom assembler that will be used for `.asm` files and a custom emulator used for emulating the operating system and hardware components.

## Emulator
The emulator is designed to follow closely with how the real hardware will work. Optimizations will be prevalent on the smaller steps (not using a PLA and suc (as the real CPU would), just directly preforming the instruction).

`Connectivity` - 2 PS/2 Ports, 2 Serial Ports<br>

## PS/2 Ports
The PS/2 Ports are apart of the design so that the computer can interface with later technologies that can be converted to a PS/2 type.

Currently the only planned support for a PS/2 device is a PS/2 keyboard (such as the IBM Model M).

## Serial Ports
These ports are apart of the design so that
